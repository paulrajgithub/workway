# Workway
### An app allowing users to share documents (homework, etc.) with each other and getting rewarding in the process

---

### What is this
Workway makes it easy to organize, share, and find homework among many other documents. Users can select and edit while automatically tagging documents to allow for quick and convenient organization, and then share them with the online community. When a post is liked, the user gets rewarded in the form of a cryptocurrency, which can then be cashed out later for actual money.
